This is a JavaScript React app written in Typescript using the Model View Controller pattern. For the love of brie is a tool to help you creatively think of charcuterie boards. The idea was sparked out of seeing the rise in small gatherings because of safety concerns around COVID. With the rise of hosting having a place to plan out and store creative ideas arount charcuterie boards seem like a simple, practical idea for anyone. This is an app that will allow you to create a board that allows you in put img urls and add descriptions to each idea you add. Someone can also sign up for a subscription service that allows you to receive monthly boards that have a arrangement of ideas for someone to use for inspiration.

The app is divided into an admin and a user side. The user can edit their own account, look at the boards they create, edit, add or delete board entries. As well as sign up for a subscription service, edit subscription information or delete subscription. To use the app go to fortheloveofbrie.herokuapp.com. Register a user. Once you've entered a few of charcuterie board ideas you can see how fun it is to build your own special hosting projects. The admin can very all users, edit all users inputs and delete and edit all boards and subscriptions.
